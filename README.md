# Weaver Solver

The Weaver Solver is a Python program designed to solve word transformation puzzles. Given a starting word and a target word, the solver finds a sequence of valid words to transform the starting word into the target word, changing one letter at a time.

## How it Works

The program uses breadth-first search to find the shortest answer. Currently, I am working on improving the time and space complexity of the application.
